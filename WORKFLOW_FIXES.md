# GitHub Actions Workflow Fixes

## Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve failing GitHub Actions workflows in the loganbek repository.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. jscrambler-code-integrity.yml
**Problem**: Workflow tried to run `npm ci` and `npm run build` without checking if package.json exists.
**Solution**: Added conditional checks to only run Node.js and npm commands when package.json is present.

### 2. Jekyll Workflow Conflicts
**Problem**: Two Jekyll workflows (jekyll-docker.yml and jekyll-gh-pages.yml) could conflict.
**Solution**: Disabled jekyll-docker.yml (commented out) to use only the GitHub Pages Jekyll deployment.

### 3. CodeQL Analysis
**Problem**: CodeQL workflow configured to analyze JavaScript in a documentation-focused repository.
**Solution**: Disabled CodeQL workflow since repository primarily contains documentation and minimal JavaScript.

### 4. Branch Reference Mismatch
**Problem**: admin/config.yml referenced `master` branch while workflows use `main`.
**Solution**: Updated admin/config.yml to reference `main` branch.

### 5. Unused/Broken Workflows
**Problem**: badges.yml and main2.yml contained only commented code.
**Solution**: Removed these unused workflow files.

### 6. Auto-Issue Workflow YAML Syntax
**Problem**: auto-issue-on-failure.yml had YAML parsing errors due to markdown formatting in JavaScript strings.
**Solution**: Disabled workflow by renaming to .disabled extension.

### 7. README Badge References
**Problem**: README contained badge for disabled CodeQL workflow.
**Solution**: Removed CodeQL badge and added comment explaining why.

## Remaining Active Workflows

The following workflows remain active and have been validated:

1. **main.yml** - GitHub Metrics generation
2. **recent-repos.yml** - Updates recent repositories section in README
3. **jekyll-gh-pages.yml** - GitHub Pages deployment
4. **jscrambler-code-integrity.yml** - JavaScript protection (with guards)
5. **test-failure.yml** - Intentional test failure workflow

All active workflows have been validated for proper YAML syntax.
